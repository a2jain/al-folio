I am an AI resident at [Google Research](https://ai.google/research/) with the NLU team. Prior to residency, I was at UC San Diego where I completed my Masters in CS. I was also a member of [BergLab](https://icebergnlp.github.io/), advised by [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/). During grad school, my research focused on controlled generation and representation learning.

My research interests are broadly in Natural Language Processing, with a special focus on unsupervised learning, controlled generation, and learning semantic representations.

Outside research I like to teach myself new languages (check out my <img src="assets/img/duolingo.png" width="20" height="20"> [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/aashi7jain)). I also enjoy running, playing tennis, meditating, reading biographies.
